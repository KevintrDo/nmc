                Overall, the people living there are one of the nicest individuals I'll ever
                get to meet. Food is probably the best I've ever ate. <br>SEASONED TO THE MAX. But
                it brought me and others alike on a journey that I'll never forget.

            <p>
                Lived there for two years. Wish I could live there forever. Food is so unseasoned
                unless the manager was Korean, American, or non-German. <br>Almost got lost in a black forest.
                Nearly died because is was 5PM!!! AND IT WAS ALMOST PITCH DARK. Overall, had some of
                my fondest memories made in Germany.

            <p>
                Australia has one of the most vicious animals that will try to literally kill you.
                When I bushed climbed a mountain, I came across... Spiders, Leeches, centipedes,
                Boars, Birds, A FREAKING TASMANIAN DEVIL (ON A MOUNTAIN!!), and more. <br> 
                Food was pretty rad, but lacked diversity. Went scuba diving at the grand barrier reef
                and sailed a boat. Also ziped lined and went cave diving where I also almost went
                into the deep dark because my instructors failed to catch me during a jump. <br> Overall,
                the best experience for adrenaline!

            <p>
                Went to a geological spring and mann that was good. Hiking had the best scenery
                known to mankind. Green all around with wildlife that will capture your eyes. <br>
                People are super nice and food taste real that I might think I'm living in a simulation.
                <br> Overall, will visit again for a 3 day hiking.
